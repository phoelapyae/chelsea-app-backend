Experts say this could make make it difficult for people - both Afghans and Indians - who want to travel to India.\r\nBut they say it\'s the right decision because the situation remains volatile.\r\nIt\'s not clear how many Indian civilians are still stuck in Afghanistan but many have pleaded with Indian authorities on social media to evacuate them.\r\nForeign minister S Jaishankar said he was keeping an eye on the situation.','1629216112sPJw86.jpg','2021-08-17 09:31:52','2021-08-22 02:46:33',2),(7,'Will the Taliban take Afghanistan back to the past?','\"Monitoring the situation in Kabul continuously.

He was born into humble beginnings before managing to get a scholarship to the University of Zambia, and later graduated with an MBA degree from the University of Birmingham in the UK.\r\nHe went on to make a fortune in finance, property, ranching, healthcare and tourism.','1629216252LcQRDJ.jpg','2021-08-17 09:34:12','2021-08-22 02:47:01',2),(9,'He has used both aspects of his background to appeal to voters.','He told voters that they needed a successful businessman to understand how to get the economy moving in the copper-rich nation, where there is high unemployment. He also used his agricultural roots to appeal to the country\'s farmers, saying he could turn Zambia into a food basket for the region.\r\nBut it was Mr Hichilema\'s ability to connect with younger voters that was perhaps the biggest factor in his success. More than half of the seven million registered voters in Zambia are under the age of 35. Around one in five of them are unemployed.\r\nThe governing Patriotic Front (PF) swept to power in 2011 on the promise of \"less taxes, more money in people\'s pockets and more jobs\".

He would sometimes playfully taunt fans of Manchester United and Arsenal if their team lost.\r\nHe also congratulated Zambian players who landed big money moves to Europe, including Patson Daka, who recently joined Leicester City, and Fashion Sakala, who signed for Scottish champions Rangers. He would even comment on their pre-season friendly games, seemingly displaying a genuine interest in their careers. Mr Lungu tried similar tactics, but many felt it came across as forced.\r\nMr Hichilema would often use slang on social media, including the term \"bally\", an informal way of addressing someone as your father. Hashtags like #BallyWillFixIt was used in an effort to speak the language of people in the markets and bars, not just the business elites.','1629216407pcN7Kj.jpeg','2021-08-17 09:36:47','2021-08-17 09:36:47',1),(11,'Mr Hichilema has shown resilience in his political career','Mr Hichilema has shown resilience in his political career. Along with his five electoral losses, he often reminds people that he has been arrested 15 times since getting into politics.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, he was charged with treason for allegedly failing to give way to the presidential motorcade. He spent four months in a maximum-security jail before the charges were dropped.\r\n\r\nIn his acceptance speech, President-elect Hichilema extended an olive branch to his predecessor.\r\n\r\n\"Don\'t worry, you\'ll be OK, you won\'t face retribution or get teargassed,\" said Mr Hichilema, who was often attacked in what he said were attempts to silence and intimidate him as an opposition leader.\r\n\r\nAfter finally getting the top job, Mr Hichilema will no doubt be celebrating.

agile,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chelseafc.com/en/teams/first-team/kepa-arrizabalaga?pageTab=biography\">Kepa</a>&nbsp;possesses fantastic reflexes and has developed his all-round game since he established himself as Athletic Bilbao&rsquo;s first-choice &lsquo;keeper. A great shot-stopper, he is confident with the ball at his feet and capable of playing out from the back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>2018/19</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spanish international goalkeeper signed a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge and ended his first season with silverware as we beat Arsenal in the Europa League final.

Whether asked to play in her regular midfield role, at centre-half or in either full-back position, Bright&rsquo;s form never fluctuated and this was recognised by her peers as she was voted the Chelsea Players&rsquo; Player of the Year to go along with the Young Player of the Year award she retained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having shone at Under-23s level for England and captained the side, full international recognition came in the autumn of 2016 when she was awarded her first cap for the Lionesses in a 2-0 win over Belgium in September. Two months later she was named England Young Player of the Year, capping an excellent year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new three-and-a-half year contract followed at the start of 2017 and it was just the beginning of an excellent year for a player who has made a marked improvement in each campaign as a Blue. Bright was a near-permanent fixture in the side as the left-sided defender in a back three as we conceded only five goals in all competitions by the end of 2017 Spring Series, and she also netted twice herself to underline her threat from attacking set-pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having forced her way into the England reckoning at the tail-end of 2016, Bright then displaced former Blues centre-half Laura Bassett in the team for the 2017 Euros and she started every game in the Lionesses&#39; run to the semi-finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That form continued in 2017/18 when she once again excelled at both club and international level. Her 33 starts in all competitions were more than any other player made as she missed only four matches all season as the Blues boasted the most miserly defence in the English top flight, conceding only 13 goals. She scored a vital one of her own in our 2-2 draw against Manchester City, rattling in an absolute screamer from inside the box, as well as netting a less crucial goal in our 10-0 win over London Bees in the FA Cup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BRIGHT AGAINST MANCHESTER UNITED</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bright&rsquo;s form was recognised outside of Chelsea, too, as she was one of five Blues nominated for the PFA Women&rsquo;s Player of the Year award.

She scored two goals last season and her first one was a stunning 30-yard strike against Bosnian champions SFK 2000 Sarajevo to kick-start our Champions League campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now a prominent figure in Phil Neville&rsquo;s England squad, Bright featured in her first World Cup and played in five out of seven games at France 2019 to help the Lionesses reach the semi-final stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having stepped up in a leadership capacity for Chelsea as vice-captain throughout the 2018/19 season, Bright remains in the role and assists her central defence partner&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chelseafc.com/en/teams/women/magdalena-eriksson?pageTab=biography\">Magdalena Eriksson</a>&nbsp;who has taken the armband from the retired Karen Carney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bright reads the game very well, often starting many attacks with a sweeping pass from the back and is a threat in the opposition box at set-pieces due to her stature. Thunderous tackles are her calling card, regularly geeing up the home support at Kingsmeadow with a crunching challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A talented horse rider in her youth, Bright joined Doncaster from the Sheffield United Centre of Excellence in 2009 and progressed through the England junior ranks to under-23 level. At Doncaster she was shortlisted for the FA Women&rsquo;s Super League 2 Player of the Year award in 2014 having excelled for the Belles as they narrowly missed out on promotion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of the 2020/21 campaign, Bright committed her long-term future with to Chelsea by signing a contract extension to keep her at the club until 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bright was a consistent performer across the 2020/21 campaign, helping the Blues secure the WSL, the Continental League Cup and reach the UEFA Women&rsquo;s Champions League final for the first time in our history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partnering skipper Magda Eriksson in the heart of the Chelsea defence, Bright helped the Blues keep 25 clean sheets in all competitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her performances throughout the 2020/21 campaign were rewarded with a place in the Team GB squad for the Tokyo Olympics.</p>','2021-08-20 06:29:45','2021-08-29 09:05:26'),(28,2,2,1,6,'MAREN MJELDE','1629464641E7HO6N.jpeg','MAREN MJELDE28-background-image.jpeg',18,'1989-08-16','Bergen, Norway','1.66m (5 ft 5 in)','63kg','<h3><strong>Highly-rated Norway captain Maren Mjelde linked up with Chelsea in January 2017 and is an integral part of the side whether playing in midfield or in the back-line.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mjelde made her name with Arna-Bjornar in her homeland before reaching the Women&rsquo;s Champions League semi-finals with Turbine Potsdam, who also finished runners-up in the German Cup and League competitions in her first season at the club. She enjoyed a spell in Sweden with Gothenborg before returning to Norway to compete for Avaldsnes IL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her level of expertise was immediately apparent when she took well to English football and the Chelsea side as if she had been here for years. After initially impressing in defence, including a dogged performance against Birmingham in the Women&rsquo;s FA Cup semi-final while she was suffering with a migraine, Mjelde went on to star in midfield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She barely put a foot wrong in or out of possession, typically making the right judgement of when to pass or to hold onto the ball, and winning it back with a mixture of tenacity and intelligent positional play.

Her only goal was a well-placed shot in a win at Sunderland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was further success for Mjelde during the 2017/18 season when she added the WSL 1 title and Women&#39;s FA Cup to her trophy collection; incredibly, the latter triumph at Wembley Stadium was the first final she had won in her career after several near misses, and she did so with a typically virtuoso display at the heart of a back three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That performance was in contrast to how Mjelde had started the campaign, when she played in her more familiar midfield role and opened up with a wonderful goal against Bristol City on the opening day, which was followed up in our next WSL1 game against Liverpool with the winner in a 1-0 victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, it was only an injury to Anita Asante in the spring which necessitated her move further back, but her performance levels never dropped. Her game intelligence came to the fore in a crucial end of season game against Birmingham when, with the scores level at 1-1 in stoppage time, she charged forward to intercept the ball on the left wing, which led to the winning goal from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chelseafc.com/en/teams/women/erin-cuthbert?pageTab=biography\">Erin Cuthbert</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all she made 34 appearances, the second highest tally in the squad, and captained the side twice. Her tally of five goals was bettered by only six players and her form was recognised by her opponents in the WSL1, who nominated her for Women&rsquo;s Player of the Year and in the Team of the Season. She ended the campaign by signing a new three-year contract with the club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite Mjelde starting last season, after a long-standing pelvic injury which was sustained at the end of the 2017/18, the Norwegian eventually had to give in to the pain and sit out. After a long absence, she came back into the side in the spring of 2019 and looked like she had never been away. Her highlight of the season came against Paris Saint-Germain in the second-leg of the Women&rsquo;s Champions League when she scored a screamer in stoppage time which sent Chelsea through to the semi-finals of the European competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has been a regular for her country since her teens, filling several defensive roles for Norway including right-back for the first time in her career when skippering the side to a breakthrough victory over Germany in the UEFA Women&rsquo;s Euro 2013 group stage. Yet she has picked up the majority of her international caps, which are more than 100 in total, as a defence-minded central midfielder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mjelde captained her country to the quarter-finals of the 2019 Women&rsquo;s World Cup and played in all five matches in the heart of defence alongside Chelsea defender Maria Thorisdottir. The experienced player had an incredible tournament and stepped up to take a spot-kick in Norway&rsquo;s Round of 16 match, contributing to her teams&rsquo; 4-1 triumph on penalties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mjelde shone for the Blues during the first half of the 2020/21 campaign, consistently producing impressive performances whether deployed in defence or midfield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Norwegian international signed a contract extension in January 2021 to keep her at the club until June 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mjelde made 32 appearances and netted four times, including two penalties in our two-legged round of 16 tie against Atletico Madrid, before her season was cut short due to a knee injury picked up during our Continental League Cup final victory against Bristol City.</p>','2021-08-20 06:34:01','2021-08-29 09:05:57'),(29,3,2,1,1,'SOPHIE INGLE','1629474121jRsIfE.jpeg','SOPHIE INGLE29-background-image.jpeg',5,'1991-07-18','Llandough, Penarth, Wales','1.73m (5 ft 8 in)','62 kg','<h3><strong>Wales international captain Sophie Ingle rejoined Chelsea Women ahead of the 2018/19 campaign.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The midfielder, who previously played for the club in 2012 and 2013, signed from Liverpool on a two-year contract and brings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>plenty of Women&rsquo;s Super League experience to the Chelsea squad, having spent the past two-and-a-half years on Merseyside and the two before that at Bristol Academy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ingle played her early Women&rsquo;s Premier League football at Cardiff City Ladies where she won the Welsh Cup.

That was followed by a clinical brace at Arsenal and another two in front of 2,406 fans at Wheatsheaf Park against Liverpool, the first of which won the club&rsquo;s Goal of the Season award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, her winner against Sunderland before the mid-season break turned out to be her last notable contribution of the year, as a serious knee injury picked up while on England duty sidelined her until the closing weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Injury was a factor again at the start of 2017, ruling her out of our Women&rsquo;s FA Cup campaign and the opening three matches of the Spring Series. What followed from there, however, was the stuff of dreams for any centre-forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kirby came off the bench against Sunderland to put the seal on a 7-0 victory with two trademark finishes when through on goal, showing everyone exactly what type of threat the side had been lacking in her absence. Further strikes followed against Liverpool, Bristol City (twice) and Birmingham on the final day; remarkably, having started just twice and come on in three matches, she had netted six times to finish as the top scorer of the Spring Series.

Her goals were spread out in all competitions and of all different styles - whether finishing like a true poacher or smashing one in from 25 yards, Kirby&rsquo;s all-round forward play was simply too hot for most sides to handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were so many magical moments across the course of the campaign, beginning with an unforgettable away goal in Munich to help us progress in the Champions League and ending with a spectacular opener in a vital WSL1 win over Birmingham City. In between there was a hat-trick versus Liverpool in the Continental Tyres Cup, an FA Cup semi-final winning brace against Manchester City, followed by the third goal in the final against Arsenal with a trademark curler, and goals in all but one round of the Champions League.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was deservedly named in the PFA Team of the Year and UEFA Champions League squad of the season. As well as picking up the PFA and FWA Player of the Year awards - becoming the first player to win the female version of the latter - she was also named Chelsea Ladies&#39; Player of the Year and Players&#39; Player of the Year.

The following month, Kirby was diagnosed with the rare condition called pericarditis &ndash; an illness which causes inflammation to the fluid-filled sac around the heart &ndash; after the Blues&rsquo; 1-0 victory over Manchester United which kept her side-lined for 16 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the Blues forward recovered in time for the 2020/21 campaign and came back stronger than ever scoring 25 goals and contributing with many assists in all competitions. Kirby netted her first goal since her return in our first home match of the WSL against Bristol City and since then has played a huge role in our successes last term helping the team to back-to-back league titles, retaining the Conti Cup and reaching the Champions League final for the first time in our history. Kirby&rsquo;s outstanding performances were rewarded and she picked up three of the most prestigious individual accolades. She was named Chelsea Women&rsquo;s Player of the Year, as well as the Barclays FA Women&rsquo;s Super League Player of the Season. Kirby also got voted as the PFA Players&#39; Player of the Year &ndash; an award that is decided by the votes of fellow professional footballers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kirby became Chelsea&rsquo;s all-time leading goalscorer after netting a brace against Benfica in the Champions League in December to overtake former Blue Eni Aluko&rsquo;s 68-goal record.

It had been 10 years since they had won at the home of their city rivals and the wait for the next victory would be even longer &ndash; finally arriving in 2013/14, when they shocked La Liga to claim the title. This season, however, would be very different, as things swiftly went south.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the spring, with the club 17th in the standings, a tearful Ranieri resigned. Hasselbaink eventually finished with 24 La Liga goals to his name, but that proved to be half of his side&rsquo;s tally in the league, and they were relegated. Too good to go down?
